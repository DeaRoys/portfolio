# Introduction
- Education
- I am Dea Roys. I am entering my final year at
James Cook University, where I am pursing
my career in Information Technology. During
my studies, I have learned fundamentals of
Information Technologies that include
programming using Python, Java etc. , web
development, cloud computing and database
modelling.
I have also done an internship program at
Hello World AI where I did the back end
developing for the new mobile app My
Weekly Dash. 
My goal is to channel my enthusiasm for
technology into developing creative solutions
that tackle complex challenges and positively
influence the world. 
By combining technical expertise with
innovation and flexibility, I aim to contribute
to projects that drive progress and empower
both individuals and communities.
